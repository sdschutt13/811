## Add any R packages you require. 
## Here are some we will use in 811:
requires <- c("tidyverse", ## tidyverse includes dplyr and ggplot2
              "magrittr",
              "foreign",
              "readstata13",
              "here")

## Install any you don't have
to_install <- c(requires %in% rownames(installed.packages()) == FALSE)
install.packages(c(requires[to_install], "NA"), repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org/" )

## Load all required R packages
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2); theme_set(theme_minimal())
library(magrittr)
library(here)

### Research Interests
My focus is on Presidential elections, and more specifically on how emotions and mental health affect voting behavior. Other interests include purple state politics, correct voting, elite decision-making and state politics of Wisconsin.

### Questions I hope to answer
How does anxiety affect information processing during elections? How do anxiety and depression affect voter turnout and vote choice?
